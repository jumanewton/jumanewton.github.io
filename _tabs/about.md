## 👋 Hi, I’m Newton  

I’m a **Computer Science student at Maseno University** and an **AI & Mobile Development enthusiast**.  
Currently, I serve as the **Mobile Development Lead at GDSC Maseno (2024/2025 Chapter)**, where I guide students in building real-world apps with **Flutter** and **Firebase**.  

## 🔭 What I Do
- 🧠 **Deep Learning & AI** – Computer Vision, NLP, and applied machine learning.  
- 📱 **Mobile Development** – Flutter apps with Firebase & backend integration.  
- 🌐 **Backend Development** – FastAPI & Node.js (with MongoDB).  
- 📊 **Data Science** – Visualization, analysis, and predictive modeling.  

## 🚀 Projects & Research
- **Rebuild of Qwen3 Model** – Implemented a replica of the Qwen3 LLM from scratch in Python (Colab). Achieved strong NLP accuracy despite limited dataset size and compute, demonstrating ability to optimize advanced architectures under constraints.  
- **HealthMate – AI-Powered Health Assistant** – Cross-platform Flutter app integrating AI/ML for medication tracking, real-time monitoring, and emergency alerts—showcased full-stack expertise across mobile, cloud, and AI deployment.  
- **RAG-Based Health Assistant** – Designed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with Gemini + Groq Cloud. Scaled to 5,000+ documents/month, providing low-latency, high-reliability health data insights.  
- **Model Chaining & Experiment Tracking** – Deployed multiple ML models with Docker Compose & LangChain. Integrated MLflow for experiment tracking, versioning, and scalable multi-model pipelines.  
- **Dialogflow & FastAPI Chatbot** – Built an LLM-powered chatbot with Dialogflow + FastAPI for order tracking and customer support, applying NLP and REST API development for real-world automation.  

## 🌱 Currently Exploring 
- Scalable AI pipelines with containerization & orchestration. 
- Advanced Computer vision and Reinforcement learning for IoT devices.
- LLM-based medical assistants & multimodal AI.  
- Scalable deep learning workflows with distributed systems.
- Advanced medical image analysis with **PyTorch & MONAI**.
